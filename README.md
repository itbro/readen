# Readen

## About
Readen is an application to help people learning a foreign language. If you like reading foreign texts you may find the app useful.
This release is for those who speak Russian and are learning English. It runs on your local server, so it can be used offline.
The app consists of 2 parts: the Sources and the Dictionary. The Dictionary is linked to the Sources.

## System Requirements
Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7  
Apache/2.4  
PHP 7.2  
MySQL 5.7  
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Яндекс.Браузер (the latest releases)

## Installation
1. Edit the file _db_settings.php_ according to your database settings.
2. Run the file _setup.php_ on your browser (just go to http://localhost/setup.php).  
   If everything goes right the message "Well done! :)" will appear on the screen.  

Now, you can use the Sources (http://localhost/) and the Dictionary (http://localhost/dictionary/).

I hope you enjoy Readen!
